  Hello everyone and welcome to my Github! I'm a Computer Science and Engineering University student who plans on sitting in front of a computer and coding all day for a living. Sound great right? In all seriousness, I do enjoy programming and am on my way to making a career out of it. In the mean time, you now have permission to check out some of my repos.
